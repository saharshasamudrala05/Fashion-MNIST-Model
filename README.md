Dataset
The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of 10 different fashion categories, such as T-shirts, trousers, dresses, and more.

Kaggle Fashion MNIST Dataset
Requirements
To run the model, make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow matplotlib
Model Architecture
The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras. Below is a summary of the architecture:

Input Layer: 28x28 pixel images (grayscale).
Convolutional Layer: 32 filters of size 3x3, followed by ReLU activation.
Max Pooling Layer: 2x2 pool size.
Dropout Layer: 25% dropout rate.
Flatten Layer: Flatten the output from the previous layer.
Dense Layer: 128 units with ReLU activation.
Output Layer: 10 units with softmax activation for classification.
Training the Model
Hereâ€™s the code snippet for training the model:

python
Copy code
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import fashion_mnist

# Load the dataset
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = fashion_mnist.load_data()
train_images = train_images.reshape((60000, 28, 28, 1)).astype('float32') / 255.0
test_images = test_images.reshape((10000, 28, 28, 1)).astype('float32') / 255.0

# Define the model
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Dropout(0.25),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_split=0.2)

# Evaluate the model
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)
print('Test accuracy:', test_acc)
Results
After training the model for 10 epochs, it achieved an accuracy of 91.31% on the test dataset.
